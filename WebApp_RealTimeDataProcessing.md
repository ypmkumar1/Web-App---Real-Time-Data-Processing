This project demonstrates a wide range of AWS services to showcase my proficiency in AWS.

Project Title: Serverless Web Application with Real-Time Data Processing

Overview:
Build a serverless web application that displays real-time data from IoT devices. The application will ingest, process, store, and visualize the data. This project will demonstrate my skills in AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront, IAM, and more.

Architecture:
1.	IoT Devices → 2. AWS IoT Core → 3. Lambda (Data Processing) → 4. DynamoDB (Data Storage) → 5. API Gateway → 6. Lambda (API) → 7. S3 (Static Web Hosting) → 8. CloudFront (CDN) → 9. Cognito (User Authentication)

Steps to Implement:
1. Set Up IoT Data Ingestion:
•	AWS IoT Core:
o	Create an IoT thing and configure it to send data to AWS.
o	Use MQTT to publish messages to an IoT topic.

2. Real-Time Data Processing:
•	AWS Lambda:
o	Create a Lambda function that triggers from the IoT topic.
o	Process incoming data (e.g., parse JSON, validate, enrich).
o	Store processed data in DynamoDB.

3. Data Storage:
•	Amazon DynamoDB:
o	Create a DynamoDB table to store the processed data.
o	Use a partition key and sort key that make querying the data efficient.

4. API to Fetch Data:
•	Amazon API Gateway:
o	Create RESTful API endpoints to fetch data from DynamoDB.
o	Integrate API Gateway with Lambda functions that query DynamoDB.

5. Frontend Development:
•	Amazon S3:
o	Develop a static web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
o	Host the web application on S3.
o	The frontend will call the API Gateway to fetch and display real-time data.
•	Amazon CloudFront:
o	Configure CloudFront to serve the static web content with low latency.
o	Enable SSL/TLS for secure data transmission.

6. User Authentication:
•	Amazon Cognito:
o	Set up a user pool in Cognito to handle user sign-up, sign-in, and authentication.
o	Integrate Cognito with the web application to protect the API endpoints.

7. Implement CI/CD Pipeline:
•	AWS CodePipeline & CodeBuild:
o	Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of Lambda functions and the web application.
o	Use CodeBuild to automate testing and packaging.

8. Monitoring and Logging:
•	Amazon CloudWatch:
o	Set up CloudWatch to monitor the Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.
o	Use CloudWatch Logs for logging Lambda function execution details.

9. Security and Permissions:
•	IAM Roles and Policies:
o	Define IAM roles and policies to ensure that each service has the minimum necessary permissions.
o	Implement least privilege principles for all AWS services.

Technologies and Services Used:
•	AWS Lambda
•	Amazon API Gateway
•	Amazon DynamoDB
•	Amazon S3
•	Amazon CloudFront
•	AWS IoT Core
•	Amazon Cognito
•	AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild
•	Amazon CloudWatch
•	IAM Roles and Policies

Project Deliverables:
1.	Architecture Diagram: Show how all the components interact.
2.	Code Repositories: Share your GitHub repo with the code for Lambda functions, frontend application, and infrastructure as code (e.g., using AWS CloudFormation or Terraform).
3.	Live Demo: Deploy the application to AWS and provide a live demo link.
4.	Documentation: Include project documentation with setup instructions, a description of the architecture, and how to scale the solution.

Discussion Points:
•	Scalability: Explain how the serverless architecture allows the application to scale seamlessly with demand.
•	Security: Discuss the security measures implemented, such as IAM roles, Cognito for authentication, and CloudFront for DDoS protection.
•	Cost Optimization: Explain how using serverless services like Lambda and DynamoDB helps optimize costs by paying only for what you use.
•	Real-Time Data Processing: Highlight how the system processes and visualizes real-time data from IoT devices.

Value Proposition:
This project demonstrates a broad understanding of AWS services, serverless architectures, and best practices in cloud computing. It's an excellent showcase of my ability to design, develop, and deploy scalable, secure, and cost-effective solutions on AWS.
